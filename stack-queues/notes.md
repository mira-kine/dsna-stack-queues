# Stack queues

## Lecture

- data stack is .push .pop
- queue -> en and de
  - can be used with single linked lists
  - queues continue on outside of the list (can add data afterwards)
- stack - its like stacking up books so whatever you put in first is at the bottom and if you wanna take out the first, have to go thru the ones added later
- pop() -> removes top item from stack
- push() -> puts item back on stack
- peek() -> return item at top of stack (whats at top?)
- isEmpty() -> if no items in stack, return boolean
